# use own requirements.txt
- in root directory create new file `/requirements.txt`
- write content `-r sessions/5/egor_fedorov/requirements.txt` and direct to your own requirements.txt
- `/requirements.txt` is in .gitignore, so every student has his/her own version of requirements.txt managed by PyCharm
